Executing the bash script

To make the script executable, assign execution rights to your user using this command:

chmod u+x run_all.sh
Here,

chmod modifies the ownership of a file for the current user :u.
+x adds the execution rights to the current user. This means that the user who is the owner can now run the script.
run_all.sh is the file we wish to run.
You can run the script using any of the mentioned methods:

sh run_all.sh
bash run_all.sh
./run_all.sh

Comments in bash scripting
Comments start with a # in bash scripting. This means that any line that begins with a # is a comment and will be ignored by the interpreter.

Variables and data types in Bash:

Variables let you store data. You can use variables to read, access, and manipulate data throughout your script.

There are no data types in Bash. In Bash, a variable is capable of storing numeric values, individual characters, or strings of characters.

ex:

country=Pakistan

same_country=$country


Variable naming conventions

In Bash scripting, the following are the variable naming conventions:

Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (_).
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters.
Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
Avoid using reserved keywords, such as if, then, else, fi, and so on as variable names.
