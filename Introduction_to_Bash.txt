Overview of Bash shell and command line interface

The term "shell" refers to a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is one of the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells and is the default shell in many Linux distributions.

When a shell is used interactively, it displays a $ when it is waiting for a command from the user.

If the shell is running as root (a user with administrative rights), the prompt is changed to #. The superuser shell prompt looks like this:

[root@host ~]#

Although Bash is a type of shell, there are other shells available as well, such as Korn shell (ksh), C shell (csh), and Z shell (zsh). Each shell has its own syntax and set of features, but they all share the common purpose of providing a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system.

You can determine your shell type using the ps command:

ps

Generally, commands follow this syntax:

command [OPTIONS] arguments

few basic bash commands:

date  : Displays the current date
pwd   : Displays the present working directory
ls    : Lists the contents of the current directory.
echo  : Prints a string of text, or value of a variable to the terminal.
